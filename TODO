Allow omission of 0| for the fixed part in model formula
Allow 1 to be used in place of cons in model formula
Allow use of attach() -ed data

Add data= as alias to indata=
Automatic calculation of VPC?

Add error checking based on input specification (e.g. binary responses are 0/1, etc)
Check MM/CAR ids/weights to ensure they are valid before running MLwiN
Allow specification of all ID/Weight columns instead of assuming they are consecutive
Display hierarchy information in the model output
Check all variables in the model actually exist in the data
Allow more data variables by finding empty columns for output rather than hardcoding column numbers
Fix CAR model example when running in OpenBUGS
Fix negative reported observations for some multivariate models
Allow pausing before the model fit to check the specification/starting values
Add checking for mixed response models (MLwiN allows Normals plus binaries OR Poissons, all discrete responses must use the same link function)
Revisit interactions, e.g. the following doesn't work: formula=log(obs,logexp)~(0|nation[]+nation[]:uvbi)+(2|cons)
Add an option to allow the model to be set up but not run, useful for example if we just want to run a BUGS model or see the MLwiN syntax
Allow starting values to be specified for IGLS models

Not currently implemented:
Multinomial proportions - need manual calculation/reshaping
Constraints (IGLS) - RCON/FCON commands
Allow negative variances (IGLS) - RESE command
Extra binomial/poisson/negative binomial/multinomial variation (IGLS) - EXTR command
Allow user specified design matrix (IGLS) - SETD command
Debugging option to extract internal model matrices (IGLS) - XSS/VMAT/ZMAT/YRES/YMAT/XMAT commands

Extra checks required:

IGLS:
Check model is univariate if weights are specified
Check lower levels are non-equal standardised weights if standardised weights are specified
Don't allow MCMC specific options to be specified

MCMC:
Don't allow leverage/deletion/influence/etc residuals
Check model is multivariate if factors are specified
Check CAR is only specified at one level (unless CAR mean centring is specified)
Check responses are valid for MCMC (e.g. no Negbinom or mixtures including Poisson, or link functions other than probit)
Don't allow IGLS specific options to be specified

All:
Check distribution and link functions are valid
Check model has more than one level if > MQL1 specified
Check denom has been specified with binomial models
Check model is Poisson/Negbinom if offset is specified
Check binary response are 0/1 and binomial are 0-1
Check Poisson response are integer and >= 0
Check there are no variables random at level 1 if model is discrete
Check multinomial models have >=3 responses
Check base category is defined (and exists in the data) for multinomial models
Check hierarchical centring level is >=2
Check model is univariate if measurement error is specified
Check ordered multinomial base is either the highest or lowest value
