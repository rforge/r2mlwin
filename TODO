Changes/Bug fixes
Make offset optional for Poisson and Negative-binomial
Add implementation for predict, residuals, df.residual and fitted methods
Revisit interactions, e.g. the following doesn't work: formula=log(obs,logexp)~(0|nation[]+nation[]:uvbi)+(2|cons)
Revisit cross-classification specification as this should apply to the whole model, rather than level by level
Allow specification of all ID/Weight columns instead of assuming they are consecutive
Fix CAR model example when running in OpenBUGS
Automatically switch equation display for cross-classified models

Data Checks:
Check all variables in the model actually exist in the data

Model Specification Checks:
Check chosen link function is valid for the chosen distribution
(IGLS) Check lower levels are non-equal standardised weights if standardised weights are specified

Additional Functionality:
Allow omission of 0| for the fixed part in model formula
Allow use of attach() -ed data
Allow optional specification of the level IDs in the formula, e.g. (student|cons+standlrt) instead of (1|cons+standlrt), levID="student"
Automatic calculation of VPC?
Debugging option to extract internal model matrices (IGLS) - XSS/VMAT/ZMAT/YRES/YMAT/XMAT commands
Allow user specified design matrix (IGLS) - SETD command
Multinomial proportions - need manual calculation/reshaping
Add an option to allow the model to be set up but not run, useful for example if we just want to run a BUGS model or see the MLwiN syntax
