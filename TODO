Changes/Bug fixes
Allow smat option to apply to more than one level
Make offset optional for Poisson and Negative-binomial
Add implementation for predict, residuals, df.residual and fitted methods
Revisit interactions, e.g. the following doesn't work: formula=log(obs,logexp)~(0|nation[]+nation[]:uvbi)+(2|cons)
Revisit cross-classification specification as this should apply to the whole model, rather than level by level
Allow specification of all ID/Weight columns instead of assuming they are consecutive
Fix CAR model example when running in OpenBUGS
Don't generate starting residuals for cross-classified models
Automatically switch equation display for cross-classified models

Data Checks:
Check all variables in the model actually exist in the data
(MCMC) Check MM/CAR ids/weights to ensure they are valid before running MLwiN

Model Specification Checks:
Check denom has been specified with binomial models
Check model is Poisson/Negbinom if offset is specified
Check there are no variables random at level 1 if model is discrete
Check multinomial models have >=3 responses
Check base category is defined (and exists in the data) for multinomial models
Check ordered multinomial base is either the highest or lowest value
Check no level-1 random variables are defined for binomial responses
Check response types for mixed response models (MLwiN allows Normals plus binaries OR Poissons, all discrete responses must use the same link function)
(IGLS) Check model has more than one level if > MQL1 specified
(IGLS) Check lower levels are non-equal standardised weights if standardised weights are specified
(MCMC) Check hierarchical centring level is >=2

Additional Functionality:
Allow omission of 0| for the fixed part in model formula
Allow use of attach() -ed data
Allow optional specification of the level IDs in the formula, e.g. (student|cons+standlrt) instead of (1|cons+standlrt), levID="student"
Automatic calculation of VPC?
Debugging option to extract internal model matrices (IGLS) - XSS/VMAT/ZMAT/YRES/YMAT/XMAT commands
Allow user specified design matrix (IGLS) - SETD command
Multinomial proportions - need manual calculation/reshaping
Add an option to allow the model to be set up but not run, useful for example if we just want to run a BUGS model or see the MLwiN syntax
