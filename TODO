When writing out documentation (Rd files), roxygen2 issues warnings that @s3method has been deprecated and that @export should be used instead

Bug when using generic update function:
Non-standard requirement that the intercept is explicitly specified might cause some confusion:
> a <- formula(normexam ~ 1 + standlrt + (1|student))
> a
normexam ~ 1 + standlrt + (1 | student)
> a <- update(a, .~. + sex)
> a
normexam ~ standlrt + (1 | student) + sex
...add note to help pages (or possible to resolve via changes to R2MLwiN?) Note on CMM R2MLwiN webpage added.

Model Specification Checks:
(IGLS) Check lower levels are non-equal standardised weights if standardised weights are specified

Additional Functionality:
Automatic calculation of VPC?
Debugging option to extract internal model matrices (IGLS) - XSS/VMAT/ZMAT/YRES/YMAT/XMAT commands
Allow user specified design matrix (IGLS) - SETD command
Multinomial proportions - need manual calculation/reshaping - e.g. <denom> in multinomial is actually not used (or doesn't need to be used as always 1), therefore this could instead be counts per unit e.g. log(resp, counts)... D="Unordered Multinomial"
Add an option to allow the model to be set up but not run, useful for example if we just want to run a BUGS model or see the MLwiN syntax
Add more error checking
Allow display of models results in alternative measures (e.g. correlations, standard deviations, etc)
Investigate interactions with RStudio, as sometimes graphs can behave strangely
Add option to omit data from output objects, as well as modify postestimation functions to take this into account
Link to the texreg package to allow prettier table outputs
Store and display information regarding the Priors in the MCMC output
