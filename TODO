Changes/Bug fixes
Revisit cross-classification specification as this should apply to the whole model, rather than level by level
Allow specification of all ID/Weight columns instead of assuming they are consecutive

Model Specification Checks:
(IGLS) Check lower levels are non-equal standardised weights if standardised weights are specified

Additional Functionality:
Automatic calculation of VPC?
Debugging option to extract internal model matrices (IGLS) - XSS/VMAT/ZMAT/YRES/YMAT/XMAT commands
Allow user specified design matrix (IGLS) - SETD command
Multinomial proportions - need manual calculation/reshaping
Add an option to allow the model to be set up but not run, useful for example if we just want to run a BUGS model or see the MLwiN syntax
