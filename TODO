Allow omission of 0| for the fixed part in model formula
Allow use of attach() -ed data

Automatic calculation of VPC?

Check MM/CAR ids/weights to ensure they are valid before running MLwiN
Allow specification of all ID/Weight columns instead of assuming they are consecutive
Display hierarchy information in the model output
Check all variables in the model actually exist in the data
Fix CAR model example when running in OpenBUGS
Fix negative reported observations for some multivariate models
Add checking for mixed response models (MLwiN allows Normals plus binaries OR Poissons, all discrete responses must use the same link function)
Revisit interactions, e.g. the following doesn't work: formula=log(obs,logexp)~(0|nation[]+nation[]:uvbi)+(2|cons)
Add an option to allow the model to be set up but not run, useful for example if we just want to run a BUGS model or see the MLwiN syntax
Allow smat option to apply to more than one level
Make offset optional for Poisson and Negative-binomial
Add implementation for predict, residuals, df.residual and fitted methods

Not currently implemented:
Multinomial proportions - need manual calculation/reshaping
Allow user specified design matrix (IGLS) - SETD command
Debugging option to extract internal model matrices (IGLS) - XSS/VMAT/ZMAT/YRES/YMAT/XMAT commands
Allow maximum IGLS iterations to be specified (and report in the output along with convergence indicator)

Extra checks required:

IGLS:
Check lower levels are non-equal standardised weights if standardised weights are specified

All:
Check model has more than one level if > MQL1 specified
Check denom has been specified with binomial models
Check model is Poisson/Negbinom if offset is specified
Check there are no variables random at level 1 if model is discrete
Check multinomial models have >=3 responses
Check base category is defined (and exists in the data) for multinomial models
Check hierarchical centring level is >=2
Check ordered multinomial base is either the highest or lowest value
Check no level-1 random variables are defined for binomial responses
