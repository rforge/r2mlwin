Model Specification Checks:
(IGLS) Check lower levels are non-equal standardised weights if standardised weights are specified

Additional Functionality:
Automatic calculation of VPC?
Debugging option to extract internal model matrices (IGLS) - XSS/VMAT/ZMAT/YRES/YMAT/XMAT commands
Allow user specified design matrix (IGLS) - SETD command
Multinomial proportions - need manual calculation/reshaping
Add an option to allow the model to be set up but not run, useful for example if we just want to run a BUGS model or see the MLwiN syntax
Add more error checking
Add support for multiple MCMC chains when calling MLwiN
Automate multiple imputation (maybe using mi package)
Allow display of models results in alternative measures (e.g. correlations, standard deviations, etc)
Investigate interactions with RStudio, as sometimes graphs can behave strangely
Add option to omit data from output objects, as well as modify postestimation functions to take this into account
