Allow omission of 0| for the fixed part in model formula
Allow 1 to be used in place of cons in model formula
Allow use of attach() -ed data

Add data= as alias to indata=
Automatic calculation of VPC?

Add error checking based on input specification (e.g. binary responses are 0/1, etc)
Check MM/CAR ids/weights to ensure they are valid before running MLwiN
Allow specification of all ID/Weight columns instead of assuming they are consecutive
Display hierarchy information in the model output
Check all variables in the model actually exist in the data
Allow more data variables by finding empty columns for output rather than hardcoding column numbers
Fix CAR model example when running in OpenBUGS
Fix negative reported observations for some multivariate models
Allow pausing before the model fit to check the specification/starting values
Add checking for mixed response models (MLwiN allows Normals plus binaries OR Poissons, all discrete responses must use the same link function)
Revisit interactions, e.g. the following doesn't work: formula=log(obs,logexp)~(0|nation[]+nation[]:uvbi)+(2|cons)

Not currently implemented:
Multinomial proportions - need manual calculation/reshaping
Constraints (IGLS) - RCON/FCON commands
Allow negative variances (IGLS) - RESE command
Extra binomial/poisson/negative binomial/multinomial variation (IGLS) - EXTR command
Allow user specified design matrix (IGLS) - SETD command
Debugging option to extract internal model matrices (IGLS) - XSS/VMAT/ZMAT/YRES/YMAT/XMAT commands
